    "Apple___Apple_scab": {
        "solution": "Apple scab is a fungal disease that affects apple trees, causing dark, scabby spots on leaves, fruit, and branches. To prevent and manage this disease, its essential to use fungicides like chlorothalonil or myclobutanil. These should be applied early in the season, even before the leaves fully emerge, and reapplied as needed. Additionally, planting apple varieties that are resistant to scab, such as Liberty or Enterprise, can greatly reduce the risk of infection. Regular pruning is also important; removing infected leaves, twigs, and fruit helps stop the spread of the fungus. Ensuring your trees receive proper care, including sufficient water, nutrients, and good airflow, can also strengthen their resistance to diseases like apple scab. These practices together will help keep your apple trees healthy and reduce the impact of scab.",
